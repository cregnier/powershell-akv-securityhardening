# Azure Policy Compliance Report - Enhanced Workflow
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-08

## Recent Enhancements (2026-01-08)

### 1. Friendly Policy Names
Policy GUIDs are now automatically replaced with friendly, readable names throughout all reports:

**Before:**
```
Policy: a6abeaec-4d90-4a02-805f-6b26c4d3ffd9
Status: NonCompliant
```

**After:**
```
Policy: Azure Key Vaults should use private link (a6abeaec-4d90-4a02-805f-6b26c4d3ffd9)
Status: NonCompliant
```

**Mapped Policies:**
- `a6abeaec-4d90-4a02-805f-6b26c4d3ffd9` → "Azure Key Vaults should use private link"
- `cf820ca0-f99e-4f3e-84fb-66e913812d21` → "Azure Key Vault should have diagnostic logging enabled"

### 2. Evaluation Count Explanation
Reports now include clear explanations why evaluation counts can exceed vault counts:

**CSV Header Comments:**
```csv
# NOTE: Evaluation count may exceed vault count because Azure Policy evaluates:
# - Each Key Vault resource itself
# - Individual secrets within each vault
# - Individual keys within each vault
# - Individual certificates within each vault
# Example: 5 vaults with 2 secrets each = 5 vault evaluations + 10 secret evaluations = 15 total
```

**JSON Metadata:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "note": "Evaluation count includes vault-level and resource-level evaluations (secrets, keys, certificates)"
  }
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Report Footers
All generated reports (HTML, JSON, CSV) now include metadata footers with:
- Script name that generated the report
- Exact command used
- Mode (DevTest vs Production)
- Generation timestamp
- Workflow Run ID

**HTML Footer Example:**
```html
<div style="margin-top: 40px; padding-top: 20px; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">
    <p><strong>Generated by:</strong> Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1</p>
    <p><strong>Command:</strong> .\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1 -WorkflowRunId 20260108-115947</p>
    <p><strong>Timestamp:</strong> 2026-01-08 14:30:22</p>
    <p><strong>Workflow Run ID:</strong> 20260108-115947</p>
</div>
```

**CSV Footer Comments:**
```csv
# Generated by: Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1
# Command: .\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1 -WorkflowRunId 20260108-115947
# Timestamp: 2026-01-08 14:30:22
```

**JSON Metadata:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "generatedBy": "Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1",
    "command": ".\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1 -WorkflowRunId 20260108-115947",
    "timestamp": "2026-01-08T14:30:22",
    "workflowRunId": "20260108-115947"
  }
}
```

## Original Enhancements (Compliance Data Timing)

### 1. Intelligent Waiting for Compliance Data
The workflow test now detects when Azure Policy compliance data isn't available yet and offers three options:

**[W] Wait and check now** - Re-queries Azure Policy immediately
**[L] Wait Later** - Keep resources alive and re-run compliance report manually  
**[C] Continue** - Proceed with testing, ignore missing compliance data

### 2. New Standalone Script: Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1
Re-generates ONLY the compliance report without re-running the entire workflow.

**Usage:**
```powershell
.\scripts\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1 -WorkflowRunId 20260107-130310

# With resource group filter:
.\scripts\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1 -WorkflowRunId 20260107-130310 -ResourceGroupName rg-policy-keyvault-test
```

### 3. Helpful Reminders
- Cleanup prompt now reminds users they can keep resources to wait for compliance data
- Script provides exact command to re-run compliance report
- Updated documentation in QUICK_START.md with troubleshooting steps

## Workflow Behavior

### Before (Old):
1. Assign policies
2. Wait 5 seconds (not enough!)
3. Generate compliance report (always shows 0 evaluations)
4. Continue with remediation
5. User has no way to get real compliance data

### After (New):
1. Assign policies  
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Generate compliance report  
4. **DETECT if 0 evaluations found**
5. **PAUSE and offer options:**
   - [W] Re-query now
   - [L] Keep resources, re-run later with standalone script
   - [C] Continue anyway
6. At cleanup prompt, remind about re-generation option
7. User can run: `.\scripts\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1` anytime

## Files Modified

1. **scripts/Run-ForegroundWorkflowTest.ps1**
   - Added compliance data detection after Step 3.5
   - Added interactive pause with W/L/C options
   - Updated cleanup prompt with reminder

2. **scripts/Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1** (NEW)
   - Standalone script to re-query Azure Policy
   - Regenerates HTML/JSON/CSV compliance reports
   - Shows helpful tips if still no data available

3. **docs/QUICK_START.md**
   - Updated troubleshooting section
   - Added examples for Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1
   - Explained 3 options for handling delayed compliance data

## Testing Recommendations

### Scenario 1: Fast Testing (Ignore Compliance Data)
- Run workflow test
- At policy validation pause, choose [C] Continue
- At cleanup prompt, choose [Y] Yes to remove resources
- Result: Fast test cycle, compliance report will be placeholder

### Scenario 2: Wait for Real Compliance Data (Immediate)
- Run workflow test  
- At policy validation pause, choose [W] Wait
- Script re-queries Azure Policy
- If data available, compliance report updates
- If still not ready, try [L] instead

### Scenario 3: Wait for Real Compliance Data (Later)
- Run workflow test
- At policy validation pause, choose [L] Wait Later
- At cleanup prompt, choose [N] No (keep resources)
- Wait 15-30 minutes
- Run: `.\scripts\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1 -WorkflowRunId <timestamp>`
- Open updated compliance report
- Manually cleanup when done

## Next Steps

Test the new workflow:
```powershell
.\scripts\Run-ForegroundWorkflowTest.ps1
# When prompted about compliance data, try [W] or [L] options
```

If you kept resources, test standalone regeneration:
```powershell
.\scripts\Regenerate-ComplianceReport.ps1 -WorkflowRunId 20260107-130310
```
