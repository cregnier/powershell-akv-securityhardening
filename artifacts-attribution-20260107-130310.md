# Artifacts Attribution — Workflow Run 20260107-130310

This file maps artifacts generated for workflow run `20260107-130310` to the producing script(s) and notes on evidence.

## Summary
- Invoker: `Run-ForegroundWorkflowTest.ps1` (interactive runner) — it generated the `WorkflowRunId` `20260107-130310` and invoked `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1` with `-DevTestMode`.
- Core artifact generator: `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1` (produces baseline, policy assignments, compliance, remediation, after-remediation, and comprehensive report artifacts).

- Workflow-Comprehensive-Report-20260107-130310.json — Generated by: `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1` (contains `"workflowRunId": "20260107-130310"` and remediation logs).
- artifacts-manifest-20260107-130310.json — Generated by: `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1` (manifest of files produced during the workflow run).
- artifacts-summary-20260107-130310.csv — Generated by: `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1` (summary CSV grouping artifacts for the run).

## Attribution reasoning
- The `artifacts-manifest-20260107-130310.json` lists the per-step JSON/HTML for the run — that manifest is emitted by the main workflow orchestration in `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1`.
- The comprehensive JSON report contains `workflowRunId: 20260107-130310` and includes logs with `[DevTestMode]` which indicates the workflow was invoked with `-DevTestMode`.
- `Run-ForegroundWorkflowTest.ps1` is the script that sets `WorkflowRunId` and calls `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1` with `-DevTestMode` in interactive runs — therefore artifacts show both: immediate generator is `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1`, invoker was `Run-ForegroundWorkflowTest.ps1` for this run.

## Notes / Caveats
- `Run-FullWorkflowTest.ps1` also calls `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1` in automated E2E tests; if you find artifacts without the `[DevTestMode]` markers or with different run IDs and no interactive prompts in logs, they may have been produced by the FullWorkflow test runner or by direct invocation of `Run-CompleteWorkflow.ps1`.
- Some artifacts (like `resource-tracking-*.json`) can be produced by environment setup scripts such as `Create-PolicyTestEnvironment.ps1` during test runs; attribute these by checking the created timestamps and the resource-tracking contents.
